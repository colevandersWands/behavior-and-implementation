# behavior-and-implementation

we give them a snippet of code.  
1. they come up with a bunch of passing test cases (behavior)
2. they expand the code and check to make sure it passes the same tests (implementation)
3. they try to recompress the code slightly differently from how it originally was (refactoring)

learning objectives:
* the {name, args, expected} test format
* testing & behavior
* behavior vs implementation
* three layers -> set initial values, execute logic, log results
